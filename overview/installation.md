**Once Catana is installed, other members of your organization will not be prompted to follow this step.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">Enrol repositories</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
Manually enrolling a repository allows each team and project to decide whether they'd like to opt-in.
{% endhint %}



After installing the GitHub application, you'll be redirected back to Catana where you'll choose\
which repositories you'd like to enrol. You can choose as many repositories as you want!

Enrolling a repository enables the following functionalities:

* üîç   Let Catana **search and process existing TODOs.**
* **üíæ    Record upcoming TODOs** whenever a git push occurs on the release branch (usually `main` or `master`).
* ‚úÖ   **Add a failing or successful CI check** **status** on Pull Requests introducing a TODO.

This operation can take a few minutes based on how large the repository is and the number of TODOs found.
